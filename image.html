<p><img src="facebook.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="facebook "> - Notice that we have only specified a relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look for the image at "https://www.facebook.com/images/facebook.gif".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>
